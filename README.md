virtual music boxes
This is a simple webapp
It behaves as a music box, there are different themes of music you have to select one of them. On a new webpage corrosponding
music box will open.
You will see two button 
1.play - It will allow you to play the corrosponding music but you have to press it in a regular interval just as you do in a 
music box.
2.reset - It will stop the music and you can start from beginning

Hope you like it.
Thank You!
