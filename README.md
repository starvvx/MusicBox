# MusicBox

Ever came across a Music Box?

No? don't worry you're not the only one who haven't seen one.

Visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_box if you want to know what a music box is.

Here, I tried to implement a virtual music box having the same functionality as the normal music box. It has two modes 

1. Music box mode: Just like we rotate the lever of a music box, you have to press the play button repeatedly in order to play the music.

2. Listening mode: It is more like an automatic version of music box, just press the play button once and the music will continue playing.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
